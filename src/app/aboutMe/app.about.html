            Hello! My name is Baxter John. I am a student in the Georgetown University class of 2026, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and Economics. 
            I made this simple website to showcase my talents and projects while revealing a bit more about myself as a person, and I am excited to keep expanding it.

            For the first 17 years of my life, I lived in New Canaan, Connecticut. In my free time, I played hockey and video games, and I loved watching the New York Rangers play.
            I also took up guitar in middle school, and picked it up again during the pandemic. I went to high school at Fairfield College Preparatory School, where I rowed crew for one year.

            Before my senior year of high school, my family and I moved to London and I finished my high school education at the American School in London. I was nervous at first,
            but it didnt take me long to love London and all it had to offer. I quickly became interested in football, and enjoy watching the Fulham games with my family. I also love
            traveling and taking the time to explore Europe.
